This project aim to explore the question: Can eating disorders be linked to mental health? This question is crucial because mental health plays a fundamental role in people's lives and society as a whole. Poor mental health affects our well-being, work performance, and relationships with friends, family, and the broader community. Mental health conditions are widespread, with hundreds of millions of individuals affected each year, and many more experiencing them over the course of their lives. It is estimated that one in three women and one in five men will experience major depression at some point in their lives. Understanding this relationship is important for researchers and healthcare professionals, as it provides an additional tool for addressing mental health disorders. By focusing on dietary habits as a potential root cause, treatments could move beyond traditional chemical interventions to include dietary changes as a primary treatment strategy. The dataset provided offers valuable information on conditions such as Schizophrenia, Anxiety, Depression, and Bipolar Disorder.

If this question remains unaddressed, we risk continuing with conventional mental health treatments without considering the possibility that underlying eating disorders—such as food intolerances, like gluten sensitivity could be contributing to the problem. Without awareness, patients may unknowingly consume foods that are toxic to them, leading to physical and mental health repercussions.

#Findings:
Linear Regression (Model 1) is considered the best option, with an R² of 99.21%. This indicates that 99.21% of the variance in the data can be explained by the model, demonstrating a very good fit.

#Conclusion:
The chosen model explains 99.21% of the variation in eating disorders based on variables such as schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, country, and year. With an R² close to 1, the model provides useful insights into the factors influencing eating disorders.

According to the data, there is a close relationship between mental health conditions and eating disorders. Identifying this relationship opens the door to more in-depth investigations. For instance, surveys could help determine the connection between diet and improvements in mental health conditions.

#Refining Business Knowledge for Decision-Making: The model we identified helps explain the variation in eating disorders through mental health conditions with strong accuracy. However, there is still much more to explore in order to develop more targeted interventions—such as examining the relationship between mental health and the elimination of sugar from the diet, or the restriction of foods that may be toxic for certain individuals, like gluten. Collaborating with health researchers is crucial for identifying opportunities to expand research on how nutrition can serve as a tool to improve mental health. Understanding this connection is valuable for both researchers and healthcare professionals, as it offers an additional approach to addressing mental health disorders. By viewing dietary habits as a potential root cause, treatment strategies could go beyond traditional pharmaceutical methods and include nutritional changes as a core part of care. The dataset used provides valuable insights into conditions such as schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder.
