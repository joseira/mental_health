This project aim to explore the question: Can eating disorders be linked to mental health?

#Findings:
Linear Regression (Model 1) is considered the best option, with an R² of 99.21%. This indicates that 99.21% of the variance in the data can be explained by the model, demonstrating a very good fit.

#Conclusion:
The chosen model explains 99.21% of the variation in eating disorders based on variables such as schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, country, and year. With an R² close to 1, the model provides useful insights into the factors influencing eating disorders.

According to the data, there is a close relationship between mental health conditions and eating disorders. Identifying this relationship opens the door to more in-depth investigations. For instance, surveys could help determine the connection between diet and improvements in mental health conditions.

#Refining Business Knowledge for Decision-Making: The model we identified helps explain the variation in eating disorders through mental health conditions with strong accuracy. However, there is still much more to explore in order to develop more targeted interventions—such as examining the relationship between mental health and the elimination of sugar from the diet, or the restriction of foods that may be toxic for certain individuals, like gluten. Collaborating with health researchers is crucial for identifying opportunities to expand research on how nutrition can serve as a tool to improve mental health. Understanding this connection is valuable for both researchers and healthcare professionals, as it offers an additional approach to addressing mental health disorders. By viewing dietary habits as a potential root cause, treatment strategies could go beyond traditional pharmaceutical methods and include nutritional changes as a core part of care. The dataset used provides valuable insights into conditions such as schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder.
