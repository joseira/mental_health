# Mental_Health
This project aims to explore the question: Can eating disorders be linked to mental health?
This question is critical, as mental health plays a foundational role in individual well-being and societal functioning. Poor mental health affects not only our quality of life, but also our work performance and relationships with friends, family, and the wider community. Mental health conditions are highly prevalent—affecting hundreds of millions of people each year, with many more impacted throughout their lives. It is estimated that one in three women and one in five men will experience major depression at some point in their lifetime.

Understanding the relationship between mental health and eating disorders is essential for researchers and healthcare professionals. It offers an additional pathway to address mental health challenges. By exploring dietary habits as a potential root cause, treatments could evolve beyond traditional pharmaceutical approaches to include nutritional strategies as primary interventions. The dataset used in this project provides valuable insights into conditions such as schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder.

If this question remains unexamined, we risk continuing to rely solely on conventional treatments—overlooking the possibility that underlying dietary issues, such as food intolerances (e.g., gluten sensitivity), may be contributing to mental health problems. Without proper awareness, individuals may unknowingly consume foods that are harmful to them, leading to both physical and psychological consequences.

# Findings
Linear Regression (Model 1) was identified as the most effective model, with an R² of 99.21%. This suggests that 99.21% of the variance in eating disorder data can be explained by the selected variables, demonstrating a very strong model fit.

# Conclusion
The chosen model effectively explains 99.21% of the variation in eating disorders based on variables such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, country, and year. With an R² value close to 1, the model provides actionable insights into the factors influencing eating disorders.

The data reveals a strong link between mental health conditions and eating disorders. Recognizing this connection opens the door to more in-depth research, including surveys and case studies that explore the relationship between dietary patterns and improvements in mental health outcomes.

# Refining Business Knowledge for Decision-Making
The model we developed highlights a significant connection between eating disorders and mental health conditions, with a high degree of accuracy. However, much remains to be explored in order to develop more precise and personalized interventions. Future research could investigate how eliminating certain foods—such as sugar or gluten—affects individuals with specific mental health diagnoses.

Collaboration with health researchers is essential to uncover new opportunities for expanding the use of nutrition as a therapeutic tool. Understanding this link is valuable for both researchers and healthcare providers, offering an alternative approach to treatment that integrates nutrition with mental health care. Rather than relying solely on pharmaceutical methods, treatment strategies could incorporate dietary changes as a central component.
